--- abstract


DCCP communications as defined in {{RFC4340}} are restricted to a single path per
connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The
simultaneous use of available multiple paths for a DCCP session could
improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user
experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to
network failures.
Use cases for a Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) are mobile devices (e.g., handsets, vehicles) and residential home gateways simultaneously connected to distinct networks as, e.g., 
a cellular and a Wireless Local Area (WLAN) networks
or a cellular and a fixed access networks. Compared to existing multipath protocols, such as MPTCP, MP-DCCP provides specific support for non-TCP user
traffic (e.g., UDP or plain IP).  More details on potential use cases are provided in {{multipath-dccp.org}}, {{IETF115.Slides}}, and {{MP-DCCP.Paper}}.
All these use cases profit from an Open Source Linux reference implementation provided under {{multipath-dccp.org}}.

This document specifies a set of extensions to
DCCP to support multipath operations.  Multipath DCCP provides 
the ability to simultaneously use multiple
paths between peers.  The protocol offers
the same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the
components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows across
different paths simultaneously.

# Introduction {#intro}

Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) {{RFC4340}} is a
transport protocol that provides bidirectional unicast connections of
congestion-controlled unreliable datagrams. DCCP communications are restricted to one single path. 
Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) is a set of extensions to DCCP to
enable DCCP flows to be established across multiple paths
simultaneously. Such extensions are beneficial to applications that transfer
large amounts of data, due to the possibility to aggregate capacity of the
multiple paths. In addition, the multipath extensions enable to tradeoff timeliness and reliability,
which is important for low-latency applications that do not require
guaranteed delivery services, such as Audio/Video streaming.

MP-DCCP has been first suggested
in the context of the 3GPP work on 5G multi-access solutions
{{I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-framework-mpdccp}} and for hybrid access
networks {{I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture}}{{I-D.muley-network-based-bonding-hybrid-access}}.
MP-DCCP can be applied for load-balancing, seamless session handover, and bandwidth
aggregation purposes (referred to as Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS)
in the 3GPP terminology {{TS23.501}}).

This document presents the protocol changes required to add multipath
support to DCCP; specifically, those for signaling and setting up
multiple paths (a.k.a, "subflows"), managing these subflows, reordering of
data, and termination of sessions.

DCCP, as stated in {{RFC4340}} does not provide reliable and ordered
delivery. Consequently, multiple application subflows may be multiplexed over a
single DCCP connection with no inherent performance penalty 
for application subflows that do not require in-ordered delivery. DCCP
does not provide built-in support for those multiple application subflows.

In the following, the term subflow refers to DCCP subflows transmitted
via different paths (4-tuple of source and destination address/port
pairs), not to be mixed up with the "application sub-flows" mentioned in
Section 17.2 of {{RFC4340}}.
Application subflows are differing content-wise
by source and destination port per application as, for example, enabled
by Service Codes introduced to DCCP in {{RFC5595}}, and those application subflows
can be multiplexed over a single DCCP connection. For the sake of consistency
we assume that only a single application is served by a DCCP connection
here as shown in {{ref-comparison-of-standard-dccp-and-mp-dccp-protocol-stacks}}
while use of that feature should not impact DCCP operation on each single path
as noted in (Section 2.4 of {{RFC5595}}).
Application subflows can co-exist with MP-DCCP operation as defined in this document.

As pointed out in {{I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-framework-mpdccp}} the proposed encapsulation in terms of 
lightweight DCCP flow headers is more appropriate for unreliable 
IP traffic in terms of UDP and other non-TCP packets in comparison to MPTCP.
Such considerations are not detailed in the present specification. 

## Multipath DCCP in the Networking Stack {#mpdccp_network_stack}

MP-DCCP operates at the transport layer and aims to be transparent to
both higher and lower layers.  It is a set of additional features on
top of DCCP; {{ref-comparison-of-standard-dccp-and-mp-dccp-protocol-stacks}} illustrates this layering.  MP-DCCP is
designed to be used by applications in the same way as DCCP with no
changes to the application itself.

## Terminology {#terminology}

Throughout this document we make use of terms that are either specific
for multipath transport or are defined in the context of MP-DCCP,
similar to {{RFC8684}}, as follows:
 
Path: A sequence of links between a sender and a receiver, defined in
this context by a 4-tuple of source and destination address/ port pairs.

Subflow: A flow of DCCP segments operating over an individual path,
which forms part of a larger MP-DCCP connection. A subflow is started
and terminated similar to a regular (single-path) DCCP connection. The term subflow
can also be used to refer to an MP-DCCP connection with a single path.

(MP-DCCP) Connection: A set of one or more subflows, over which an
application can communicate between two hosts. The MP-DCCP connection is
exposed as single DCCP socket to the application.

Token: A locally unique identifier given to a multipath connection by a
host. May also be referred to as a "Connection ID".

Host: An end host operating an MP-DCCP implementation, and either
initiating or accepting an MP-DCCP connection. 

In addition to these
terms, within framework of MP-DCCP the interpretation of, and effect on,
regular single-path DCCP semantics is discussed in {{protocol}}.


## MP-DCCP Concept {#concept}

{{ref-example-mp-dccp-usage-scenario}} provides a general overview of the MP-DCCP working mode, whose main 
characteristics are summarized in this section.

{: #ref-example-mp-dccp-usage-scenario title='Example MP-DCCP Usage Scenario'}
 

   *  An MP-DCCP connection begins with a 4-way handshaking procedure, between 
      two hosts as described in {{handshaking}}. In {{ref-example-mp-dccp-usage-scenario}},
      an MP-DCCP connection is established between addresses A1 and B1 on Hosts
      A and B, respectively. It should be noted that MP-DCCP does not require the presence of 
      more than one address in both peers.

   *  In case extra paths and corresponding addresses/ports are available, additional DCCP subflows are created on 
      these paths and are attached to the existing MP-DCCP session, which
      continues to appear as a single connection to the applications at both
      ends. The creation of an additional DCCP subflow is illustrated between Address A2
      on Host A and Address B1 on Host B.

   *  MP-DCCP identifies multiple paths by the presence of multiple
      addresses/ports at hosts.  Combinations of these multiple addresses/ports
      equate to the additional paths.  In the example, other potential
      paths that could be set up are A1<->B2 and A2<->B2.  Although this
      additional subflow is shown as being initiated from A2, it could
      equally have been initiated from B1 or B2.

   *  The discovery and setup of additional subflows will be achieved
      through a path management method including the logic and details of the procedures for adding/removing subflows;
      this document describes supportive measures by which a host can initiate new subflows and signal available addresses 
      between peers. The definition of a path management method is, however, out of scope of this document and subject to a 
      corresponding policy and the specifics of the implementation. In the same context, if any of the MP-DCCP peer hosts has a limit on the maximum number of paths that can be maintained (e.g., similar to what is discussed in Section 3.4 of {{RFC8041}}, the creation of new subflows from that peer host should be avoided and incoming subflow requests should be terminated.

   *  MP-DCCP adds connection-level sequence numbers and exchange of
      Round-Trip Time (RTT) information to enable optional reordering features.

   *  Subflows are terminated as regular DCCP connections, as described
      in ({{RFC4340}}, Section 8.3). The MP-DCCP connection is terminated by a
      connection-level DCCP-CloseReq or DCCP-Close message.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   capitals, as shown here.



# Operation Overview {#op_overview}

DCCP (Section 17.2 of {{RFC4340}}) allows multiple application 
subflows to be multiplexed over a single DCCP connection with 
potentially same performance. However, DCCP does not provide built-in 
support for managing multiple subflows within one DCCP connection.
Various congestion control mechanisms have been specified to optimize
DCCP performance for specific traffic types in terms of profiles denoted
by a Congestion Control IDentifier (CCID).

The extension of DCCP towards Multipath-DCCP (MP-DCCP) is 
described in detail in {{protocol}}.

As a high level overview of the MP-DCCP operation, the data 
stream from a DCCP application is split 
by MP-DCCP operation into one or more subflows which can be 
transmitted via different also physically isolated paths.
The corresponding control information allows the receiver to optionally 
re-assemble and deliver the received data in the originally transmitted order to the 
recipient application. This may be necessary because DCCP does not guarantee in-order delivery.
The details of the transmission scheduling mechanism and 
optional reordering mechanism are up to the sender and receiver, respectively,
and are outside the scope of this document.

The following sections define MP-DCCP behavior in detail.

A Multipath DCCP connection provides a bidirectional connection of datagrams 
between two hosts exchanging data as in DCCP, thus, not requiring 
any change to the applications. However, Multipath DCCP enables the 
hosts to use different paths with different IP addresses to transport 
the packets of an MP-DCCP connection. MP-DCCP manages the request, 
set-up, authentication, prioritization, modification, and removal of
the DCCP subflows on different paths as well as the exchange of performance 
parameters. 

The Multipath Capability for MP-DCCP can be negotiated with a new DCCP 
feature, as specified in {{mp_capable}}. Once 
negotiated, all subsequent MP-DCCP operations for that connection are signalled with a 
variable length multipath-related option, as described in {{protocol}}.
All MP-DCCP operations are signaled with MP-DCCP suboptions described in {#MP_OPT}.

The number of DCCP subflows can vary during the 
lifetime of a Multipath DCCP connection. The details of the path management decisions for
when to add or remove subflows are outside the scope of this document.


# MP-DCCP Protocol {#protocol}

The DCCP protocol feature list ({{RFC4340}}, Section 6.4) are
enriched with a new Multipath related feature with Feature number 10, as
shown in {{ref-feature-list}}.

|Number | Meaning                      | Rule | Rec'n Value | Initial Req'd |
|:-----:|:-----------------------------|:----:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
|   10  | Multipath Capable            |  SP  |      0      |       N       |
{: #ref-feature-list title='Multipath Feature'}

Rec'n Rule:
: The reconciliation rule used for the feature. SP means server-priority,
  NN means non-negotiable.

Initial Value:
: The initial value for the feature. Every feature has a known initial value.

Req'd:
: This column is "Y" if and only if every DCCP implementation MUST
understand the feature. If it is "N", then the feature behaves like an extension, and it is safe to respond to Change options for the feature
with empty Confirm options.

The DCCP protocol options as defined in ({{RFC4340}}, Section 5.8) are enriched with 
a new Multipath related variable-length option with option type 46, as
shown in {{ref-option-list}}.

| Type  | Option Length | Meaning               | DCCP-Data? |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:---------------------:|:----------:|
|  46   |    variable   | Multipath             |     Y      |
{: #ref-option-list title='Multipath Option Set'}


## Multipath Capable Feature {#mp_capable}

DCCP endpoints negotiates the Multipath Capable Feature to decide whether multipath extensions can be enabled for a DCCP connection.

Multipath Capable feature (MP_CAPABLE) has feature number 10 and has length of one-byte.
The leftmost four bits are used to specify a compatible version of the
MP-DCCP implementation (0000 for this specification). The following four bits are unassigned in version 0. The unassigned bits MUST be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

~~~~
    0  1  2  3   4  5  6  7
   +-----------+------------+
   |  Version  | Unassigned |
   +-----------+------------+
~~~~
{: #ref-mp-capable-format title='Format of the Multipath Capable feature'}

The setting of the MP_CAPABLE feature MUST follow the server-priority reconciliation rule described
in ({{RFC4340}}, Section 6.3.1), which allows multiple versions to be
specified in order of priority.

The negotiation MUST be done as part of the initial handshake procedure
as described in {{handshaking}}, and no subsequent re-negotiation of
the MP_CAPABLE feature is allowed on the same MP-DCCP connection.

Clients MUST include a Change R option during the initial handshake request to
supply a list of supported MP-DCCP protocol versions, ordered by preference.

Servers MUST include a Confirm L option in the subsequent response to agree on
an MP-DCCP version to be used from the Client list, followed by its own
supported version(s) ordered by preference. Any subflow addition to an existing MP-DCCP connection MUST use the same
version negotiated for the first subflow.

If no agreement is found, the Server MUST reply with an empty Confirm L option
with feature number 10 and no values.


An example of successful version negotiation is shown hereafter: 

~~~~
      Client                                             Server
      ------                                             ------
      DCCP-Req + Change R(MP_CAPABLE, 1 0)
                     ----------------------------------->

                      DCCP-Resp + Confirm L(MP_CAPABLE, 1, 2 1 0)
            <-----------------------------------

                 * agreement on version = 1 *
~~~~
{: #ref-mp-capable-example title='Example of MP-DCCP support negotiation using MP_CAPABLE'}

1. The Client indicates support for both MP-DCCP versions 1 and 0, with a preference
for version 1.

2. Server agrees on using MP-DCCP version 1, and supplies its own preference list.

3. MP-DCCP is then enabled between the Client and Server with version 1.

If the version negotiation fails or the MP_CAPABLE feature is not present in the DCCP-Request or DCCP-Response packets of the initial handshake procedure, the MP-DCCP connection SHOULD fallback to regular DCCP or MUST be closed. Further details are specified in {{fallback}}


## Multipath Option {#MP_OPT}

MP-DCCP uses one single option to signal various multipath-related operations. The format of this option is shown in {{ref-mp-option-format}}.  

~~~~
            1          2          3

These operations are largely inspired by the signals defined in {{RFC8684}}.

Some multipath options require confirmation from the remote peer (see {{ref-mp-option-confirm}}). Such options will be retransmitted by the sender 
until a MP_CONFIRM is received or confirmation of options is identified outdated. The further processing of the multipath options in the
receiving host is not the subject of MP_CONFIRM.

As multipath suboptions could arrive out-of-order, suboptions defined in {{ref-mp-option-confirm}}
MUST be sent in a DCCP datagram with MP_SEQ {{MP_SEQ}}. This allows suboptions to be identified with obsolete datasets that would otherwise conflict with newer datasets. In case of MP_ADDADDR or MP_REMOVEADDR the same dataset is identified based on AddressID, whereas the same dataset for MP_PRIO is identified by the subflow in use. An outdated
suboption is detected at the receiver if a previous suboption referring to the same dataset contained a higher sequence number
carried by MP_SEQ. AN MP_CONFIRM MAY be generated for suboptions that are identified outdated.

Similarly an MP_CONFIRM could arrive out of order. To ensure that the most recent suboption is confirmed the associated
MP_SEQ received MUST be echoed. Otherwise inconsistencies could occur, e.g. if three MP_PRIO options are sent one after
the other on one path in order to first set the path priority to 0, then to 1 and finally to 0 again. Without an associated
MP_SEQ, a loss of the third MP_PRIO option and a loss of the MP_CONFIRM of the second update and the third update would
cause the sender to incorrectly believe that the priority value is set to 0 without recognizing that the receiver has applied
priority value 1.

The length of the MP_CONFIRM option and the path over which the option is sent depend on the confirmed suboptions and the received
MP_SEQ, which is both copied verbatim and appended as a list of confirmations. The list structures by first listing the received
MP_SEQ followed by the confirmed suboption or suboptions. The same rules apply when suboptions with different MP_SEQs are confirmed at
once. This might happen if a datagram with MP_PRIO and a first MP_SEQ_1 and another datagram with MP_ADDADDR and a second MP_SEQ_2 are
received in short succession. In this case, the structure described above is concatenated resulting in  MP_SEQ_1 + MP_PRIO + MP_SEQ_2 + MP_ADDADDR.

Here, a first DCCP-Data is sent from Host A to Host B with option MP_PRIO set to 4. Host A subsequently issues a second DCCP-Data with option MP_PRIO

{: #ref-MP_JOIN title='Format of the MP_JOIN Suboption'}

The MP_JOIN option is used by a host to add a new subflow to an existing MP-DCCP
connection and REQUIRES a successful establishment of the first subflow using MP_KEY.
The Path Token is the SHA256 hash of the derived key (d-key),
which was previously exchanged with the MP_KEY option.
MP_HMAC MUST be set when using MP_JOIN to provide authentication (See
{{MP_HMAC}} for details).

The MP_JOIN option includes an "Addr ID" (Address ID) generated by the sender of the option, used to identify the source
address of this packet, even if the IP header has been changed in
transit by a middlebox.  The numeric value of this field is generated
by the sender and MUST map uniquely to a source IP address for the
sending host.  The Address ID allows address removal ({{MP_REMOVEADDR}})
without needing to know what the source address at the receiver is,
thus allowing address removal through NATs.  The Address ID also
allows correlation between new subflow setup attempts and address
signaling ({{MP_ADDADDR}}), to prevent setting up duplicate subflows
on the same path, if an MP_JOIN and MP_ADDADDR are sent at the same
time.

The Address IDs of the subflow used in the initial DCCP Request/Response exchange of
the first subflow in the connection are implicit, and have the value
zero.  A host MUST store the mappings between Address IDs and
addresses both for itself and the remote host.  An implementation
will also need to know which local and remote Address IDs are
associated with which established subflows, for when addresses are
removed from a local or remote host. An Address ID always MUST be unique
over the lifetime of a subflow and can only be re-assigned if sender and
receiver no longer have them in use.

The Nonce is a 32-bit random value locally generated for every MP_JOIN option.
Together with the Token, the Nonce value builds the basis to calculate the
HMAC used in the handshaking process as described in {{handshaking}}.

If the path token can not be verified by the receiving host during a handshake negotiation, 
the new subflow MUST be closed, as specified in {{fallback}}.

### MP_FAST_CLOSE {#MP_FAST_CLOSE}

Regular DCCP has the means of sending a Close or Reset signals to abruptly close a
connection.  With MP-DCCP, a regular Close or Reset only has the scope of the
subflow over which the signal was received. As such, it will only close the applicable subflow and will not
affect the remaining subflows in use on other paths.  An MP-DCCP connection will stay alive at
the data level in order to permit break-before-make handover between
subflows.  It is therefore necessary to provide an MP-DCCP-level
"Reset" to allow the abrupt closure of the whole MP-DCCP connection;
this is done via the MP_FAST_CLOSE suboption.

For being effective, the MP_FAST_CLOSE suboption MUST be sent from an initiating host on all subflows as part of a DCCP-Reset packet with Reset Code 13. To protect unauthorized shutdown of a multipath DCCP connection, the selected Key Data of the peer host during the handshaking procedure is carried by the MP_FAST_CLOSE option. 

With completion of this step, the initiating host can tear down the subflows and the multipath DCCP connection immediately terminates.

Upon reception of the MP_FAST_CLOSE and successful validation of the Key Data at the peer host, a DCCP Reset packet is replied on all subflows to the initiating host with Reset Code 13. The peer host can now close the whole MP-DCCP connection (i.e., it transitions the connection state directly to CLOSED).

{: #ref-MP_HMAC title='Format of the MP_HMAC Suboption'}

The MP_HMAC suboption is used to provide authentication for the MP_JOIN,
MP_ADDADDR, and MP_REMOVEADDR suboptions. The HMAC code is generated according
to {{RFC2104}} in combination with the SHA256 hash algorithm described in
{{RFC6234}}, with the output truncated to the leftmost 160 bits (20 bytes).

The "Key" used for the HMAC computation is the derived key (d-key)
described in {{MP_KEY}}, while the HMAC "Message" is a concatenation of

   * MP_JOIN: The token and nonce of the MP_JOIN for which authentication
   shall be performed.

   * MP_ADDADDR: The Address ID with associated IP address
   and if defined port, otherwise two octets of value 0.
   
   * MP_REMOVEADDR: Solely the Address ID.

MP_JOIN, MP_ADDADDR and MP_REMOVEADDR can co-exist or be used multiple times
within a single DCCP packet. All these multipath options include an individual
MP_HASH option. This ensures the MP_HASH is correctly associated.
Otherwise, the receiver cannot validate multiple MP_JOIN, MP_ADDADDR or
MP_REMOVEADDR. Therefore, a MP_HASH MUST directly follow its associated multipath
option. In the likely case of sending a MP_JOIN together with a MP_ADDADDR, this
results in concatenating MP_JOIN + MP_HMAC_1 + MP_ADDADDR + MP_HMAC_2, whereas the
first MP_HMAC_1 is associated with the MP_JOIN and the second MP_HMAC_2 with the
MP_ADDADDR suboption.

If the HMAC can not be validated by a receiving host, the subsequent handling depends
on which suboption was being authenticated. If the suboption to be authenticated was either
MP_ADDADDR or MP_REMOVEADDR, the receiving host MUST silently ignore it (see {{MP_ADDADDR}} and {{MP_REMOVEADDR}}). 
If the suboption to be authenticated was MP_JOIN, the subflow MUST be closed (see {{fallback}})

The MP_RTT suboption is used to transmit RTT values in milliseconds and
MUST belong to the path over which this information is transmitted.
Additionally, the age of the measurement is specified in milliseconds.
This information is in particular useful for the receiving host to
calculate the RTT difference between the subflows and to estimate whether
missing data has been lost.

The RTT and Age information is a 32-bit integer, which allows to cover a period of
approximately 1193 hours.

Raw RTT (=0)
: Raw RTT value of the last Datagram Round-Trip preferably provided by the CCID in use.
{: vspace='0'}


Min RTT (=1)
: Min RTT value over a given period preferably provided by the CCID in use.
{: vspace='0'}


Max RTT (=2)
: Max RTT value over a given period preferably provided by the CCID in use.
{: vspace='0'}


Smooth RTT (=3)
: Averaged RTT value over a given period preferably provided by the CCID in use.
{: vspace='0'}

Age
: The Age parameter defines the time difference between now - creation of the MP_RTT option -
   and the conducted RTT measurement in milliseconds. If no previous measurement
   exists, e.g., when initialized, the value is 0.
{: vspace='0'}

In {{ref-MP_RTT_example}} an exemplary flow shows the exchange of path individual 
RTT information with RTT1 pointing to a first path and RTT2 to a second path. Those
RTT values might be extracted from the sender's Congestion Control procedure and
carried to the receiving host using MP_RTT suboption. With the reception of RTT1
and RTT2, the receiver is able to calculate the path_delta which corresponds to
the absolute difference of both values.
In the case that the path individual RTTs are symmetric in down- and uplink direction, packets
with missing sequence number MP_SEQ, e.g., in a reordering process, can be assumed
lost after path_delta/2.

### MP_ADDADDR {#MP_ADDADDR}

The MP_ADDADDR suboption announces additional addresses (and, optionally,
port numbers) on which a host can be reached. This option can be used at any
time during an existing DCCP connection, when the sender wishes to
enable multiple paths and/or when additional paths become available.
Multiple instances of this suboption within a packet advertise simultaneously
new addresses.

Length is variable depending on the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) and whether a port number is
used. This field is in range between 8 and 22 bytes.

The presence of the final 2 octets, specifying the DCCP port number to
use, are optional and can be inferred from the length of the option.
Although it is expected that the majority of use cases will use the
same port pairs as used for the initial subflow (e.g., port 80
remains port 80 on all subflows, as does the ephemeral port at the
client), there could be cases (such as port-based load balancing) where
the explicit specification of a different port is required.  If no
port is specified, the receiving peer MUST assume that any attempt to
connect to the specified address uses the port already used by the
subflow on which the MP_ADDADDR signal was sent.

Along with the MP_ADDADDR option a MP_HMAC option MUST be sent for
authentication. The truncated HMAC parameter present in this MP_HMAC
option is the leftmost 20 bytes of an HMAC, negotiated and calculated
as described in {{MP_HMAC}}. In the same way as for MP_JOIN,
the key for the HMAC algorithm, in the case of the message transmitted
by Host A, will be Key-A followed by Key-B, and in the case of Host B,
Key-B followed by Key-A.  These are the keys that were exchanged and
selected in the original MP_KEY handshake. The message for the HMAC is
the Address ID, IP address, and port that precede the HMAC in the
MP_ADDADDR option.  If the port is not present in the MP_ADDADDR option,
the HMAC message will nevertheless include 2 octets of value zero.
The rationale for the HMAC is to prevent unauthorized entities from
injecting MP_ADDADDR signals in an attempt to hijack a connection.
Note that, additionally, the presence of this HMAC prevents the
address from being changed in flight unless the key is known by an
intermediary.  If a host receives an MP_ADDADDR option for which it
cannot validate the HMAC, it SHOULD silently ignore the option.

The presence of a MP_SEQ {{MP_SEQ}} MUST be ensured in a DCCP datagram
in which MP_ADDADDR is sent. Further details are given in {{MP_CONFIRM}}.

Every address has an Address ID that can be used for uniquely
identifying the address within a connection for address removal. The
Address ID is also used to identify MP_JOIN options (see {{MP_JOIN}})
relating to the same address, even when address translators are in use.
The Address ID MUST uniquely identify the address for the sender of the
option (within the scope of the connection); the mechanism for
allocating such IDs is implementation specific.

All Address IDs learned via either MP_JOIN or MP_ADDADDR SHOULD be stored
by the receiver in a data structure that gathers all the
Address-ID-to-address mappings for a connection (identified by a token
pair). In this way, there is a stored mapping between the Address ID,
observed source address, and token pair for future processing of control
information for a connection. Note that an implementation
MAY discard incoming address advertisements, for example, for
avoiding the required mapping state, or because advertised addresses
are of no use to it (for example, IPv6 addresses when it has IPv4
only).  Therefore, a host MUST treat address advertisements as soft
state, and it MAY choose to refresh advertisements periodically.

Due to the proliferation of NATs, it is reasonably likely that one
host may attempt to advertise private addresses.  It is not
desirable to prohibit this, since there may be cases where both hosts
have additional interfaces on the same private network. A host
MAY advertise a private addresses. The MP_JOIN handshake to
create a new subflow ({{MP_JOIN}}) provides mechanisms to minimize
security risks.  The MP_JOIN message contains a 32-bit token that
uniquely identifies the connection to the receiving host. If the
token is unknown, the host will return with a DCCP-Reset. In the unlikely
event that the token is known, subflow setup will continue, but the
HMAC exchange must occur for authentication.  This will fail, and
will provide sufficient protection against two unconnected hosts
accidentally setting up a new subflow upon the signal of a private
address.  Further security considerations around the issue of
MP_ADDADDR messages that accidentally misdirect, or maliciously direct,
new MP_JOIN attempts are discussed in {{security}}.
If a sending host of an MP_ADDADDR knows that no incoming subflows can
be established at a particular address, an MP_ADDADDR SHOULD NOT
announce that address unless the sending host has new knowledge about
the possibility to do so. Such ability information can be obtained from local
firewall or routing settings, knowledge about availability of external
NAT or firewall, or from connectivity checks performed by the
host/application.

The reception of an MP_ADDADDR message is acknowledged using MP_CONFIRM
({{MP_CONFIRM}}). Using this mechanism reliable exchange of address
information is ensured.

A host MAY send an MP_ADDADDR message with an already assigned Address
ID, but the Address MUST be the same as previously assigned to this
Address ID, and the Port MUST be different from one already in use
for this Address ID.  If these conditions are not met, the receiver
SHOULD silently ignore the MP_ADDADDR.  A host wishing to replace an
existing Address ID MUST first remove the existing one ({{MP_REMOVEADDR}}).

A host that receives an MP_ADDADDR but finds a connection set up to
that IP address and port number is unsuccessful SHOULD NOT perform
further connection attempts to this address/port combination for this
connection. However, a sender that wants to trigger a new incoming
connection attempt on a previously advertised address/port combination
can therefore refresh MP_ADDADDR information by sending the option again.


### MP_REMOVEADDR {#MP_REMOVEADDR}

If, during the lifetime of an MP-DCCP connection, a previously announced
address becomes invalid (e.g., if an interface disappears), the
affected host SHOULD announce this so that the peer can remove subflows
related to this address.

This is achieved through the Remove Address (MP_REMOVEADDR) suboption which
will remove a previously added address with an Address ID from a
connection and terminate any subflows currently using that address.

Along with the MP_REMOVEADDR suboption a MP_HMAC option MUST be sent for
authentication. The truncated HMAC parameter present in this MP_HMAC
option is the leftmost 20 bytes of an HMAC, negotiated and calculated
as described in {{MP_HMAC}}. In the same way as for MP_JOIN,
the key for the HMAC algorithm, in the case of the message transmitted
by Host A, will be Key-A followed by Key-B, and in the case of Host B,
Key-B followed by Key-A.  These are the keys that were exchanged and
selected in the original MP_KEY handshake. The message for the HMAC is
the Address ID.
The rationale for the HMAC is to prevent unauthorized entities from
injecting MP_REMOVEADDR signals in an attempt to hijack a connection.
Note that, additionally, the presence of this HMAC prevents the
address from being removed in flight unless the key is known by an
intermediary.  If a host receives an MP_REMOVEADDR option for which it
cannot validate the HMAC, it SHOULD silently ignore the option.

The presence of a MP_SEQ {{MP_SEQ}} MUST be ensured in a DCCP datagram
in which MP_REMOVEADDR is sent. Further details are given in {{MP_CONFIRM}}.

The reception of an MP_REMOVEADDR message is acknowledged using MP_CONFIRM
({{MP_CONFIRM}}). Using this mechanism reliable exchange of address
information is ensured. To avoid inconsistent states, it is recommended to
release the sender address ID only after MP_REMOVEADDR has been confirmed. 

The sending and receipt of this message SHOULD trigger the sending of
DCCP-Close and DCCP-Reset by client and server, respectively on the affected
subflow(s) (if possible), as a courtesy to cleaning up middlebox state, before
cleaning up any local state.

Address removal is done by Address ID to allow the use of NATs and other
middleboxes that rewrite source addresses.  If there is no address
at the requested Address ID, the receiver will silently ignore the request.

A subflow that is still functioning MUST be closed with a DCCP-Close
exchange as in regular DCCP, rather than using this option. For more
information, see {{closing}}.


### MP_PRIO {#MP_PRIO}

In the event that a single specific path out of the set of available
paths shall be treated with higher priority compared to the others
when making scheduling decisions for payload traffic, a host may 
wish to signal such change in priority  to the peer.
One reason for such behavior is due to the different costs involved in
using different paths (e.g., WiFi is free while cellular has limit on
volume, 5G has higher energy consumption). Also, the priority of a path
could change, for example when the mobile runs out
of battery, the usage of only a single path may be the preferred choice
of the user. Therefore, the path priority SHOULD be considered as hints 
for the packet scheduler when making decisions which path to use for 
payload traffic.


The MP_PRIO suboption, shown below, can be used to set a priority flag
for the path over which the suboption is received.

The following values are available for Prio field:

*   0: Do not use. The path is not available.
*   1: Standby: do not use this path for traffic scheduling, if another
       path (secondary or primary) is available. The path will only be used if 
       other secondary or primary paths are not established. 
*   2: Secondary: do not use this path for traffic scheduling, if the other
       paths are good enough. The path will be used occasionally for increasing 
       temporarily the available capacity, e.g. when primary paths are 
       congested or are not available. This is the recommended setting for
       paths that have costs or data caps as these paths will be used less
       frequently then primary paths.
*   3 - 15: Primary: The path can be used for packet scheduling decisions. The 
       priority number indicates the relative priority of one path over the 
       other for primary paths. Higher numbers indicate higher priority. 
       The peer should consider sending traffic first over higher priority paths. 
       This is the recommended setting for paths that do not have a cost or 
       data caps associated with them as these paths will be frequently used.

Example use cases include:
1) Setting Wi-Fi path to Primary and Cellular paths to Secondary. In this case
   Wi-Fi will be used and Cellular only if the Wi-Fi path is congested or not
   available. Such setting results in using the Cellular path only temporally, 
   if more capacity is needed than the WiFi path can provide, indicating a 
   clear priority of the Wi-Fi path over the Cellular due to e.g. cost reasons.
2) Setting Wi-Fi path to Primary and Cellular to Standby. In this case Wi-Fi
   will be used and Cellular only, if the Wi-Fi path is not available. 
3) Setting Wi-Fi path to Primary and Cellular path to Primary. In this case,
   both paths can be used when making packet scheduling decisions. 

If not specified, the default behavior is, that a path can always be used for 
packet scheduling decisions (MP_PRIO=3), if the path has been established and 
added to an existing MP-DCCP connection. At least one path should have a 
MP_PRIO value greater or equal to one for it to be allowed to send on the 
connection. MP_PRIO is assumed to be exchanged reliably using the MP_CONFIRM 
mechanisms (see {{ref-mp-option-confirm}}).

The presence of a MP_SEQ {{MP_SEQ}} MUST be ensured in a DCCP datagram
in which MP_PRIO is sent. Further details are given in {{MP_CONFIRM}}.

{: #ref-MP_CLOSE title='Format of the MP_CLOSE Suboption'}

An MP-DCCP connection can be gracefully closed by sending and MP_CLOSE to the peer host. On all subflows, the regular termination procedure as described in {{RFC4340}} MUST be initiated using MP_CLOSE in the initial packet (either a DCCP-CloseReq or a DCCP-Close). In the case where a DCCP-CloseReq is used, the following DCCP-Close MUST carry the MP_CLOSE as well. At the initiator of the DCCP-CloseReq all sockets, including the MP-DCCP connection socket, transition to CLOSEREQ state. To protect unauthorized shutdown of a multi-path connection, the selected Key Data of the peer host during the handshaking procedure MUST be carried by the MP_CLOSE option and validated by the peer host. Note, Key Data is different between MP_CLOSE option carried by DCCP-CloseReq or DCCP-Close.

On reception of a first DCCP-CloseReq carrying a MP_CLOSE with valid Key Data, or due to a local decision, all subflows transition to the CLOSING state before transmitting a DCCP-Close carrying MP_CLOSE. In this case, the MP-DCCP connection socket on the host sending the DCCP-Close reflects the state of the initial subflow used during handshake with MP_KEY option. If the initial subflow no longer exists, the state moves immediately to CLOSED.

Upon reception of the first DCCP-Close carrying a MP_CLOSE with valid Key Data at the peer host, all subflows, as well as the MP-DCCP connection socket, move to the CLOSED state. After this, a DCCP-Reset with Reset Code 1 MUST be sent on any subflow in response to a received DCCP-Close containing a valid MP_CLOSE option.

When the MP-DCCP connection socket is in CLOSEREQ or CLOSE state, new subflow requests using MP_JOIN MUST be ignored.

Contrary to a MP_FAST_CLOSE {{MP_FAST_CLOSE}}, no single-sided abrupt termination is applied.

{: #ref-mp-dccp-handshaking title='Example MP-DCCP Handshake'}

The basic initial handshake for the first subflow is as follows:

* Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
  request and the MP_KEY option with an Host-specific Key-A for
  each of supported types as described in {{MP_KEY}}.

* Host B sends a DCCP-Response with Confirm feature for
  MP-Capable and the MP_Key option with a single Host-specific Key-B.
  The type of the key is chosen from the list of supported types
  from the previous request.

* Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with both Keys echoed to Host B.

* Host B sends a DCCP-Ack to confirm both keys and conclude the handshaking.

Host A waits for the final DCCP-Ack from host B before starting any
establishment of additional subflow connections.

The handshake for subsequent subflows based on a successful initial
handshake is as follows:

* Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
  request and the MP_JOIN option with Host B’s Token TB, generated from
  the derived key by applying a SHA256 hash and truncating to the first
  32 bits. Additionally, an own random nonce RA is transmitted with the
  MP_JOIN.

* Host B computes the HMAC of the DCCP-Request and sends a DCCP-Response
  with Confirm feature option for MP-Capable and the MP_JOIN option with
  the Token TB and a random nonce RB together with the computed MP_HMAC.
  The HMAC is calculated by taking the leftmost 20 bytes from the SHA256 hash
  of a HMAC code created by using token and nonce received with MP_JOIN(A) as message
  and the derived key described in {{MP_KEY}} as key:

  MP_HMAC(B) = HMAC-SHA256(Key=d-key(B), Msg=RB+RA)

* Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with the HMAC computed for the DCCP-Response.
  The HMAC is calculated by taking the leftmost 20 bytes from the SHA256 hash
  of a HMAC code created by using token and nonce received with MP_JOIN(B) as message
  and the derived key described in {{MP_KEY}} as key:

  MP_HMAC(A) = HMAC-SHA256(Key=d-key(A), Msg=RA+RB)

* Host B sends a DCCP-Ack to confirm the HMAC and to conclude the
  handshaking.

## Address knowledge exchange

### Advertising a new path (MP_ADDADDR)

When a host (Host A) wants to advertise the availability of a new path, it should use the MP_ADDADDR option ({{MP_ADDADDR}}) as
shown in the example in {{ref-mp-dccp-add-address}}. The MP_ADDADDR option passed in the DCCP-Data contains the following parameters:
* an identifier (id 2) for the new IP address which is used as a reference in subsequent control exchanges.
* the IP address of the new path (A2_IP)
* A pair of octets specifying the port number associated with this IP address. The value of 00 here, indicates that the port number is the same
  as that used for the initial subflow address A1_IP

The following options must be included in a packet carrying MP_ADDADDR:
* the leftmost 20 bytes of the HMAC(A) generated during the initial handshaking procedure described in {{handshaking}} and {{MP_HMAC}}
* the sequence number (seqno 12) for this message

Host B acknowledges receipt of the MP_ADDADDR message with a DCCP-Ack containing the MP_CONFIRM option. The parameters supplied in this
response are as follows:
* an MP_CONFIRM containing the MP_SEQ number (seqno 12) of the packet carrying the option that we are confirming together with the MP_ADDADDR option
* the leftmost 20 bytes of the HMAC(B) generated during the initial handshaking procedure {{handshaking}}

### Removing a path (MP_REMOVEADDR)
When a host (Host A) wants to indicate that a path is no longer available, it should use the MP_REMOVEADDR option ({{MP_REMOVEADDR}}) as
shown in the example in {{ref-mp-dccp-remove-address}}. The MP_REMOVEADDR option passed in the DCCP-Data contains the following parameters:
* an identifier (id 2) for the IP address to remove (A2_IP) and which was specified in a previous MP_ADDADDR message.

The following options must be included in a packet carrying MP_REMOVEADDR
* the leftmost 20 bytes of the HMAC(A) generated during the initial handshaking procedure described in {{handshaking}} and {{MP_HMAC}}
* the sequence number (seqno 33) for this message

Host B acknowledges receipt of the MP_REMOVEADDR message with a DCCP-Ack containing the MP_CONFIRM option. The parameters supplied in this
response are as follows:
* an MP_CONFIRM containing the MP_SEQ number (seqno 33) of the packet carrying the option that we are confirming, together with the MP_REMOVEADDR option
* the leftmost 20 bytes of the HMAC(B) generated during the initial handshaking procedure {{handshaking}}

## Close a MP-DCCP connection {#closing}

When a host wants to close an existing subflow but not the whole MP-DCCP
connection, it initiates the regular DCCP connection termination procedure 
as described in {{RFC4340}}, i.e., it sends a DCCP-Close/DCCP-Reset on the subflow. This
may be preceded by a DCCP-CloseReq. In the event of an irregular termination of a subflow,
e.g., during subflow establishment, it is RECOMMENDED to use an appropriate DCCP reset code as specified in
Table 2 of {{RFC4340}}. This could be, for example, sending reset code 5 (Option Error) when an MP-DCCP
option provides invalid data or reset code 9 (Too Busy) when the maximum number of maintainable paths
is reached. Note that receiving a reset code 9 for secondary subflows SHOULD NOT impact already existing active
subflows. If necessary, these subflows are terminated in a subsequent step using the procedures described in
this section. 

A host terminates an MP-DCCP connection using the DCCP connection termination specified in section 5.5 of
{{RFC4340}} on each subflow with the first packet on each subflow carrying MP_CLOSE (see {{MP_CLOSE}}).

      Host A                                   Host B

Additionally, an MP-DCCP connection may be closed abruptly using the "Fast Close"
procedure described in {{MP_FAST_CLOSE}}, where a DCCP-Reset is sent on all
subflows, each carrying the MP_FAST_CLOSE option.

## Fallback {#fallback}

When a subflow fails to operate following MP-DCCP intended behavior, it is 
necessary to proceed with a fallback. This may be either falling back 
to regular DCCP {{RFC4340}} or removing a problematic subflow. The main reasons for 
subflow failing include: no MP support at peer host, failure to negotiate protocol
version, loss of MP-DCCP suboptions, faulty/non-supported MP-DCCP options or modification
of payload data. 

At the start of an MP-DCCP connection, the handshake ensures exchange of MP-DCCP feature and
options and thus ensures that the path is fully MP-DCCP capable. If during the
handshake procedure it appears that DCCP-Request or DCCP-Response
messages do not carry the MP_CAPABLE feature, the MP-DCCP connection will not be 
established and the handshake SHOULD fallback to regular DCCP (if this is not 
possible it MUST be closed). 

A connection SHOULD fallback to regular DCCP if the endpoints fail to agree on a
protocol version to use during the Multipath Capable feature negotiation. This is described in
{{mp_capable}}. The protocol version negotiation distinguishes between negotiation
for the initial connection establishment, and addition of subsequent subflows. If
protocol version negotiation is not successful during the initial connection establishment,
MP-DCCP connection will fallback to regular DCCP. 

Similar procedure MUST be applied if the MP_KEY {{MP_KEY}} Key Type cannot be negotiated,
a final ACK carrying MP_KEY with wrong Key-A/Key-B is received or MP_KEY option is malformed.

If a subflow attempts to join an existing MP-DCCP connection, but MP-DCCP options or MP_CAPABLE
feature are not present or are faulty in the handshake procedure, that subflow MUST be closed.
This is especially the case if a different MP_CAPABLE version than the originally negotiated
version is used. Reception of a non-verifiable MP_HMAC ({{MP_HMAC}}) or an invalid
MP_JOIN Path Token {{MP_JOIN}} during flow establishment MUST cause the
subfloor to be closed.

Another relevant case is when payload data is modified by middleboxes. DCCP uses 
checksum to protect the data, as described in section 9 of {{RFC4340}}. A checksum will 
fail if the data has been changed in any way. All data from the start of the segment that
failed the checksum onwards cannot be considered trustworthy. DCCP defines that if 
the checksum fails, the receiving endpoint MUST drop the application data and report 
that data as dropped due to corruption using a Data Dropped option (Drop Code 3, 
Corrupt). If data is dropped due to corruption for an MP-DCCP connection, the affected
subflow MAY be closed.


## Congestion Control Considerations

Senders MUST manage per-path congestion status, and avoid to
sending more data on a given path than congestion control
for each path allows.

When a Multipath DCCP connection uses two or more paths, there is no
guarantee that these paths are fully disjoint.  When two (or more
paths) share the same bottleneck, using a standard congestion control
scheme could result in an unfair distribution of the bandwidth with
the multipath connection getting more bandwidth than competing single
path connections.  Multipath TCP uses the coupled congestion control
Linked Increases Algorithm (LIA) specified in {{RFC6356}} to
solve this problem.  This scheme can be adapted also for Multipath DCCP.
The same applies to other coupled congestion control schemes, which
have been proposed for Multipath TCP such as Opportunistic Linked
Increases Algorithm {{OLIA}}. The details of the congestion control
algorithms are outside the scope of this document.

## Maximum Packet Size Considerations

A DCCP implementation maintains the maximum packet size (MPS) during operation of a DCCP session. This procedure is specified for single-path DCCP in {{RFC4340}}, Section 14. Without any restrictions, this is adopted for MP-DCCP operations, in particular the PMTU measurement and the Sender Behaviour. As per this definition a DCCP application interface SHOULD let the application discover the current MPS, this is subject to ambiguity with potential different path MPS in a multipath system. 

For compatibility reasons, an MP-DCCP implementation SHOULD always announce the minimum MPS across all paths.

## Path usage strategies

MP-DCCP can be configured to realize one of several strategies for path usage, via selecting one DCCP subflow of the multiple DCCP subflows within a MP-DCCP connection for data transmission. This can be a dynamic process further facilitated by the means of DCCP and MP-DCCP defined options such as path preference using MP-PRIO, adding or removing DCCP subflows using MP_REMOVEADDR, MP_ADDADDR or DCCP-Close/DCCP-Reset and also path metrics such as packet-loss-rate, CWND or RTT provided by the Congestion Control Algorithm.
Selecting an appropriate method can allow MP-DCCP to realize different path utilization strategies that make MP-DCCP suitable for end-to-end implementation over the Internet or in controlled environments such as Hybrid Access or 5G ATSSS.

### Path mobility {#path_mobility}

The path mobility strategy provides the use of a single path with a seamless handover function to continue the connection when the currently used path is deemed unsuitable for service delivery.
Some of the DCCP subflows of a MP-DCCP connection might become inactive due to either the occurrence of certain error conditions (e.g., DCCP timeout, packet loss threshold, RTT threshold, closed/removed) or adjustments from the MP-DCCP user.
When there is outbound data to send and the primary path becomes inactive (e.g., due to failures) or de-prioritized, the MP-DCCP endpoint SHOULD try to send the data through an alternate path with a different source or destination address (depending on the point of failure), if one exists. This process SHOULD respect the path priority configured by MP_PRIO or if not available pick the most divergent source-destination pair from the original used source-destination pair.
Note: Rules for picking the most appropriate source-destination pair are an implementation decision and are not specified within this document.
Path mobility is supported in the current Linux reference implementation {{multipath-dccp.org}}.

### Concurrent path usage
Different to a path mobility strategy, the selection between MP-DCCP
subflows is here a per-packet decision that is a part of the multipath
scheduling process. This method would allow multiple subflows to be
simultaneously used to aggregate the path resources to obtain higher
connection throughput.

In this scenario, the selection of congestion control, per-packet scheduling
and potential re-ordering method determines a concurrent path utilization
strategy and result in a particular transport characteristic.

A concurrent path usage method uses a scheduling design that could seek to 
maximize reliability, throughput, minimizing latency, etc.

Concurrent path usage over the Internet can have implications. When a 
Multipath DCCP connection uses two or more paths, there is no guarantee 
that these paths are fully disjoint.  When two (or more) subflows share 
the same bottleneck, using a standard congestion control scheme could 
result in an unfair distribution of the capacity with the multipath 
connection using more capacity than competing single path connections.  
Multipath TCP uses the coupled congestion control Linked Increases 
Algorithm (LIA) specified in the experimental specification {{RFC6356}} to solve this problem.  This 
scheme could also be proposed for Multipath DCCP.  The same applies to 
other coupled congestion control schemes that have been proposed for 
Multipath TCP such as Opportunistic Linked Increases Algorithm {{OLIA}}.

The specification of scheduling for concurrent multipath and related the 
congestion control algorithms and re-ordering methods for use in the general
Internet are outside the scope of this document. If and when the IETF
specifies a method for concurrent usage of multiple paths for use in the
general Internet, the framework specified in this document could be used to 
provide an IETF recommended method for MP-DCCP.


# Security Considerations {#security}

Similar to DCCP, MP-DCCP does not provide cryptographic security
guarantees inherently. Thus, if applications need cryptographic security
(integrity, authentication, confidentiality, access control, and
anti-replay protection) the use of IPsec, DTLS over DCCP {{RFC5238}} or other
end-to-end security is recommended;
Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) {{RFC3711}} is one candidate
protocol for authentication. Together with Encryption of Header
Extensions in SRTP, as provided by {{RFC6904}}, also integrity would
be provided.

As described in {{RFC4340}}, DCCP provides protection against hijacking
and limits the potential impact of some denial-of-service attacks, but
DCCP provides no inherent protection against an on-path attacker snooping on data
packets. Regarding the security of MP-DCCP no additional risks should be
introduced compared to regular DCCP. Thereof derived are the
following key security requirements to be fulfilled by MP-DCCP:

* Provide a mechanism to confirm that parties involved in a subflow
  handshake are identical to those in the original connection setup.
* Provide verification that the new address to be included in a MP
  connection is valid for a peer to receive traffic at before using it.
* Provide replay protection, i.e., ensure that a request to add/remove a
  subflow is 'fresh'. 

In order to achieve these goals, MP-DCCP includes a hash-based handshake
algorithm documented in Sections {{MP_KEY}} and {{handshaking}}. The
security of the MP-DCCP connection depends on the use of keys that are
shared once at the start of the first subflow and are never sent again
over the network. To ease demultiplexing while not giving away any
cryptographic material, future subflows use a truncated cryptographic
hash of this key as the connection identification "token". The keys are
concatenated and used as keys for creating Hash-based Message
Authentication Codes (HMACs) used on subflow setup, in order to verify
that the parties in the handshake are the same as in the original
connection setup. It also provides verification that the peer can
receive traffic at this new address. Replay attacks would still be
possible when only keys are used;
therefore, the handshakes use single-use random numbers (nonces) at both
ends -- this ensures that the HMAC will never be the same on two handshakes.
Guidance on generating random numbers suitable for use as keys is given
in {{RFC4086}}. During normal operation, regular DCCP protection
mechanisms (such as header checksum to protect DCCP headers against
corruption) will provide the same level of protection against attacks on
individual DCCP subflows as exists for regular DCCP. 

As discussed in {{MP_ADDADDR}}, a host may advertise its private
addresses, but these might point to different hosts in the receiver's
network.  The MP_JOIN handshake ({{MP_JOIN}}) will ensure that this
does not succeed in setting up a subflow to the incorrect host.
However, it could still create unwanted DCCP handshake traffic.  This
feature of MP-DCCP could be a target for denial-of-service exploits,
with malicious participants in MP-DCCP connections encouraging the
recipient to target other hosts in the network.  Therefore,
implementations should consider heuristics at both the
sender and receiver to reduce the impact of this.

# Interactions with Middleboxes {#middlebox}

Issues from interaction with on-path middleboxes such as NATs, firewalls, proxies,
intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and others have to be considered for all
extensions to standard protocols since otherwise unexpected reactions of
middleboxes may hinder its deployment. DCCP already provides means to
mitigate the potential impact of middleboxes, also in comparison to TCP (see
{{RFC4043}}, Section 16). In case, however, both hosts are located behind a NAT or
firewall entity, specific measures have to be applied such as the {{RFC5596}}-specified
simultaneous-open technique that update the (traditionally asymmetric)
connection-establishment procedures for DCCP.  Further standardized technologies
addressing NAT type middleboxes are covered by {{RFC5597}}.

{{RFC6773}} specifies UDP Encapsulation for NAT Traversal of DCCP sessions,
similar to other UDP encapsulations such as for SCTP {{RFC6951}}. Future
specifications by the IETF could specify other methods for DCCP encapsulation.



# Implementation

The approach described above has been implemented in open source across different testbeds and a new scheduling algorithm has been extensively tested. Also 
demonstrations of a laboratory setup have been executed and have been published at {{multipath-dccp.org}}.

# IANA Considerations

This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the MP extension of the DCCP protocol 
in accordance with {{RFC8126}}.  This document defines one new value to be added to the DCCP Feature Numbers registry and three new registries to be added to the DCCP registry group. 

This document requests IANA to assign a new DCCP feature parameter for negotiating
the support of multipath capability for DCCP sessions between hosts
as described in {{protocol}}. The following entry in {{ref-add-feature-list}} should be
added to the Feature Numbers registry in the DCCP registry group according to {{RFC4340}}, Section 19.4. under the "DCCP Protocol" heading. 

| Value            | Feature Name               | Specification   |
|:----------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|
|  10 (suggested)  | MP-DCCP capability feature | [ThisDocument]  |
{:#ref-add-feature-list title='Addition to DCCP Feature Numbers registry'}

As outlined in sect. {{mp_capable}} the new 1-Byte entry above includes a 4-bit part to specify the version of the used MP-DCCP implementation. This document requests IANA to create a new 'MP-DCCP Versions' registry within the DCCP registry group to track the MP-DCCP version. The initial content of this registry is as follows: 


   |  Version  | Description | Specification  |
   |:---------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|
   |   0000    |   Version 0 | [ThisDocument] |
   |0001 - 1111|  Unassigned |                |
{:#ref-add-version-list title='MP-DCCP Versions Registry'}

Future MP-DCCP versions 1 to 15 are assigned from this registry using the Specification Required policy (Section 4.6 of {{RFC8126}}).

This document requests IANA to assign a new DCCP protocol option of type=46 as described in Section 3.2.

IANA is requested to create a new 'MP-DCCP Suboptions' registry within the DCCP registry group. The following entries in {{ref-add-proto-opt-list}} should be added to the new 'MP-DCCP Suboptions' registry. The registry in {{ref-add-proto-opt-list}} has an upper boundary of 255 in the numeric value field. 

| Value    | Symbol          | Name                                             | Reference         |

{:#ref-add-proto-opt-list title='MP-DCCP Suboptions registry'}
 
Future MP-DCCP sub-options with MP_OPT>11 are assigned from this registry using the Specification Required policy (Section 4.6 of {{RFC8126}}).

In addition IANA is requested to assign a new DCCP Reset Code value 13 (or TBD) in the DCCP Reset Codes Registry, with the short description "Abrupt MP termination".  Use of this reset code is defined in section {{MP_FAST_CLOSE}}.

In addition IANA is requested to assign for this version of the MP-DCCP protocol a new 'MP_KEY' registry containing three different sub options to the MP-KEY option to identify the MP_KEY Key types in terms of 8-bit values as specified in {{MP_KEY}} according to the entries in {{ref-mp_key-sub-opt-list}} below. Values in range 3-255 (decimal) inclusive remain unassigned in this version 0 of the protocol and are assigned via Specification Required {{RFC8126}}
in potential future versions of the MP-DCCP protocol.

| Value | Key Type             | Name or Meaning                  | Reference  |

# Differences from Multipath TCP {#diff_mptcp}

Multipath DCCP is similar to Multipath TCP {{RFC8684}}, in that it
extends the related basic DCCP transport protocol {{RFC4340}} with
multipath capabilities in the same way as Multipath TCP extends TCP
{{RFC0793}}.
However, because of the differences between the underlying TCP and DCCP
protocols, the transport characteristics of MPTCP and MP-DCCP are
different.

{{table_tcp_dccp_comp}} compares the protocol characteristics of TCP
and DCCP, which are by nature inherited by their respective multipath
extensions.  A major difference lies in the delivery of payload, which
is for TCP an exact copy of the generated byte-stream. DCCP behaves
in a different way and does not guarantee to deliver any payload nor the
order of delivery.
Since this is mainly affecting the receiving endpoint of a TCP or
DCCP communication, many similarities on the sender side can be identified.
Both transport protocols share the 3-way initiation of a
communication and both employ congestion control to adapt the sending
rate to the path characteristics.

| Feature                | TCP              | DCCP                          |

{: #table_tcp_dccp_comp title='TCP and DCCP protocol comparison'}

Consequently, the multipath features, shown in
{{table_mptcp_mpdccp_comp}}, are the same, supporting volatile paths
having varying capacity and latency, session handover and path
aggregation capabilities. All of them profit by the existence of
congestion control.

| Feature                      | MPTCP                 | MP-DCCP            |
|:----------------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
| Volatile paths               | yes                   | yes                |
| Session handover             | yes                   | yes                |
| Path aggregation             | yes                   | yes                |
| Data reordering              | yes                   | optional           |
| Expandability                | limited by TCP header | flexible           |
{: #table_mptcp_mpdccp_comp title='MPTCP and MP-DCCP protocol comparison'}

Therefore, the sender logic is not much different between MP-DCCP and
MPTCP.

The receiver side for MP-DCCP has to deal with the unreliable transport 
character of DCCP. The multipath sequence numbers included in MP-DCCP (see {{MP_SEQ}}) facilitates
adding optional mechanisms for data stream packet reordering 
at the receiver.  Information from the MP_RTT multipath option ({{MP_RTT}}), 
DCCP path sequencing and the DCCP Timestamp Option provide further means 
for advanced reordering approaches, e.g., as proposed in {{I-D.amend-iccrg-multipath-reordering}}.
Such mechanisms do, however, not affect interoperability
and are not part of the MP-DCCP protocol.  Many 
applications that use unreliable transport protocols can also inherently deal 
with out-of-sequence data (e.g., through adaptive audio and video buffers), 
and so additional reordering support may not be necessary. The addition of optional 
reordering mechanisms are most likely to be needed when the 
different DCCP subflows are routed across paths with different latencies. 
In theory, applications using DCCP are aware that packet reordering might 
happen, since DCCP has no mechanisms to prevent it.

The receiving process for MPTCP is on the other hand a rigid
"just wait" approach, since TCP guarantees reliable delivery.
