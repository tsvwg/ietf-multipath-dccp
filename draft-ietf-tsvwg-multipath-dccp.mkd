--- abstract


DCCP communication as defined in {{RFC4340}} is restricted to a single path per
connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The
simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could
improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user
experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to
network failures.
Use cases for a Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) are mobile devices (handsets, vehicles) and residential home gateways simultaneously connected to distinct paths as, e.g., 
a cellular link and a WiFi link
or to a mobile radio station and a fixed access network.  Compared to existing multipath protocols such as MPTCP, MP-DCCP provides specific support for non-TCP user
traffic as UDP or plain IP.  More details on potential use cases are provided in {{website}}, {{slide}}, and {{paper}}.
All these use cases profit from an Open Source Linux reference implementation provided under {{website}}.

This document presents a set of extensions to
traditional DCCP to support multipath operation.  Multipath DCCP provides 
the ability to simultaneously use multiple
paths between peers.  The protocol offers
the same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the
components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP subflows across
potentially disjoint paths.

# Introduction {#intro}

Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) is a set of extensions to regular DCCP
{{RFC4340}}, i.e., the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol denoting a
transport protocol that provides bidirectional unicast connections of
congestion-controlled unreliable datagrams. A multipath extension to 
DCCP enables the transport of user data  across multiple paths 
simultaneously. This is beneficial to applications that transfer fairly 
large amounts of data, due to the possibility to aggregate capacity of the 
multiple paths. In addition, it enables to tradeoff timeliness and reliability, 
which is important for low latency applications that do not require 
guaranteed delivery services such as Audio/Video streaming.
DCCP multipath operation has been suggested
in the context of 3GPP work on 5G multi-access solutions
{{I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-framework-mpdccp}} and for hybrid access
networks {{I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture}}{{I-D.muley-network-based-bonding-hybrid-access}}.
It can be applied for load-balancing, seamless session handover, and
aggregation purposes (referred to as ATSSS; Access traffic steering, switching, and splitting
in 3GPP terminology {{TS23.501}}).

This document presents the protocol changes required to add multipath
capability to DCCP; specifically, those for signaling and setting up
multiple paths ("subflows"), managing these subflows, reordering of
data, and termination of sessions.
DCCP, as stated in {{RFC4340}} does not provide reliable and ordered
delivery. Consequently, multiple application subflows may be multiplexed over a
single DCCP connection with no inherent performance penalty 
for application subflows that do not require in-ordered delivery. DCCP
does not provide built-in support for those multiple application subflows.

In the following, use of the term subflow will refer to physical
separate DCCP subflows transmitted via different paths, but not to
application subflows. Application subflows are differing content-wise
by source and destination port per application as, for example, enabled
by Service Codes introduced to DCCP in {{RFC5595}}, and those application subflows
can be multiplexed over a single DCCP connection. For sake of consistency
we assume that only a single application is served by a DCCP connection
here as shown in {{ref-comparison-of-standard-dccp-and-mp-dccp-protocol-stacks}}
while use of that feature should not impact DCCP operation on each single path
as noted in ({{RFC5595}}, sect. 2.4).

## Multipath DCCP in the Networking Stack {#mpdccp_network_stack}

MP-DCCP operates at the transport layer and aims to be transparent to
both higher and lower layers.  It is a set of additional features on
top of standard DCCP; {{ref-comparison-of-standard-dccp-and-mp-dccp-protocol-stacks}} illustrates this layering.  MP-DCCP is
designed to be used by applications in the same way as DCCP with no
changes to the application itself.

## Terminology {#terminology}

Throughout this document we make use of terms that are either specific
for multipath transport or are defined in the context of MP-DCCP,
similar to {{RFC8684}}, as follows:
 
Path: A sequence of links between a sender and a receiver, defined in
this context by a 4-tuple of source and destination address/ port pairs.

Subflow: A flow of DCCP segments operating over an individual path,
which forms part of a larger MP-DCCP connection. A subflow is started
and terminated similar to a regular (single-path) DCCP connection. The term subflow
can also be used to refer to an MP-DCCP connection with a single path.

(MP-DCCP) Connection: A set of one or more subflows, over which an
application can communicate between two hosts. The MP-DCCP connection is
exposed as single DCCP socket to the application.

Token: A locally unique identifier given to a multipath connection by a
host. May also be referred to as a "Connection ID".

Host: An end host operating an MP-DCCP implementation, and either
initiating or accepting an MP-DCCP connection. In addition to these
terms, within framework of MP-DCCP the interpretation of, and effect on,
regular single-path DCCP semantics is discussed in {{protocol}}.


## MP-DCCP Concept {#concept}

{{ref-example-mp-dccp-usage-scenario}} provides a general overview of the MP-DCCP working mode, whose main 
characteristics are summarized within this section.

{: #ref-example-mp-dccp-usage-scenario title='Example MP-DCCP Usage Scenario'}
 

   *  An MP-DCCP connection begins with a 4-way handshaking procedure, between 
      2 hosts as described in {{handshaking}}. In {{ref-example-mp-dccp-usage-scenario}}
      an MP-DCCP connection is established between addresses A1 and B1 on Hosts
      A and B, respectively.

   *  If extra paths are available, additional DCCP subflows are created on 
      these paths and are attached to the existing MP-DCCP session, which
      continues to appear as a single connection to the applications at both
      ends. The creation of an additional DCCP subflow is illustrated between Address A2
      on Host A and Address B1 on Host B.

   *  MP-DCCP identifies multiple paths by the presence of multiple
      addresses at hosts.  Combinations of these multiple addresses
      equate to the additional paths.  In the example, other potential
      paths that could be set up are A1<->B2 and A2<->B2.  Although this
      additional session is shown as being initiated from A2, it could
      equally have been initiated from B1 or B2.

   *  The discovery and setup of additional subflows will be achieved
      through a path management method; this document describes supportive measures by which a host can initiate new subflows and available addresses can be signaled between peers. The definition of a path management method is however out of scope of this document.

   *  MP-DCCP adds connection-level sequence numbers and exchange of
      RTT information to enable optional reordering functionalities.

   *  Subflows are terminated as regular DCCP connections, as described
      in ({{RFC4340}} section 8.3). The MP-DCCP connection is terminated by a
      connection-level DCCP-CloseReq or DCCP-Close message.


## Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.



# Operation Overview {#op_overview}

DCCP according to RFC 4340 {{RFC4340}} allows multiple application 
subflows to be multiplexed over a single DCCP connection with 
potentially same performance. However, DCCP does not provide built-in 
support for multiple subflows and the Congestion Manager (CM) 
{{RFC3124}}, as a generic multiplexing facility, can not fully support 
multiple congestion control mechanisms for multiple DCCP flows between 
same source and destination addresses.

The proposed extension of DCCP towards Multipath-DCCP (MP-DCCP) is 
described in detail in {{protocol}}.

As a high level overview on the key functionality of MP-DCCP, the data 
stream from a DCCP application is split 
by MP-DCCP operation into one or more subflows which can be 
transmitted via different also physically isolated paths.
The corresponding control information allows the receiver to optionally 
re-assemble and deliver the received data in the right order to the 
recipient application. The details of the transmission scheduling mechanism and 
optional reordering mechanism are up to the sender and receiver, respectively,
and are outside the scope of the MP-DCCP protocol.
The following sections define MP-DCCP behavior in detail.

The Multipath Capability for MP-DCCP can be negotiated with a new DCCP 
feature, as described and fully specified in {{protocol}}. Once 
negotiated, all subsequent MP-DCCP operations are signalled with a 
variable length multipath-related option, as described in {{mp_capable}}.

A Multipath DCCP connection provides a bidirectional byte-stream between 
two hosts exchanging data as in standard DCCP manner thus not requiring 
any change to the applications. However, Multipath DCCP enables the 
hosts to use different paths with different IP addresses to transport 
the packets of the MP-DCCP connection. MP-DCCP manages the request, 
set-up, authentication, prioritization, modification, and removal of
the DCCP subflows on different paths as well as exchange of performance 
parameters. The number of concurrent DCCP subflows can vary during the 
lifetime of the Multipath DCCP connection. All MP-DCCP operations are 
signaled with MP-DCCP options described in detail in {#MP_OPT}.


# MP-DCCP Protocol {#protocol}

The DCCP protocol feature list ({{RFC4340}} section 6.4) will be
enhanced by a new Multipath related feature with Feature number 10, as
shown in {{ref-feature-list}}.

Rec'n Rule:
: The reconciliation rule used for the feature. SP means server-priority,
  NN means non-negotiable.

Initial Value:
: The initial value for the feature. Every feature has a known initial value.

Req'd:
: This column is "Y" if and only if every DCCP implementation MUST
understand the feature. If it is "N", then the feature behaves like an extension
(see Section 15), and it is safe to respond to Change options for the feature
with empty Confirm options. Of course, a CCID might require the feature; a DCCP
that implements CCID 2 MUST support Ack Ratio and Send Ack Vector, for example.

The DCCP protocol options as defined in ({{RFC4340}} section 5.8) and ({{RFC5634}} section 2.2.1) will be enhanced
by a new Multipath related variable-length option with option type 46, as
shown in {{ref-option-list}}.

## Multipath Capable Feature {#mp_capable}

DCCP endpoints are multipath-disabled by default and multipath
capability can be negotiated with the Multipath Capable Feature.

Multipath Capable has feature number 10 and has length of one-byte.
The leftmost four bits are used to specify a compatible version of the
MP-DCCP implementation (0 for this specification).
The following four bits are reserved for further use.

~~~~
    0  1  2  3   4  5  6  7
   +------------------------+
   |  Version  |  Reserved  |
   +------------------------+
    '0000'->v0
    '0001'->v1
    ........
~~~~

Multipath Capable follows the server-priority reconciliation rule described
in ({{RFC4340}} section 6.3.1), which allows multiple versions to be
specified in order of priority.

The negotiation MUST be done as part of the initial handshake procedure
as described in {{handshaking}}, and no subsequent re-negotiation of
the Multipath Capable feature is allowed on the same MP connection.

Client MUST include a Change R option during the initial handshake request to
supply a list of supported protocol versions, ordered by preference.

Server MUST include a Confirm L option in the subsequent response to agree on
a version to be used chosen from the Client list, followed by its own
supported version(s) ordered by preference.

For example:

~~~~
      Client                                             Server
      ------                                             ------
      DCCP-Req + Change R(CAPABLE, 1 0)
                     ----------------------------------->

                      DCCP-Resp + Confirm L(CAPABLE, 1, 2 1 0)
            <-----------------------------------

                 * agreement on version = 1 *
~~~~

1. Client indicates support for both versions 1 and 0, with preference
for version 1

2. Server agrees on using version 1, and supply its own preference list.


If no agreement can be found, the Server MUST reply with an empty Confirm L option
with feature number 10 and no values.

Any subflow addition to an existing MP connection MUST use the same
version negotiated for the first subflow.

MP_CONFIRM is used to send confirmation of reception of the valid multipath 
options that require it (see {{ref-mp-option-confirm}}). Such options will be retransmitted by the sender 
until this receives the corresponding MP_CONFIRM. The further processing of the multipath options in the
receiving host is not the subject of MP_CONFIRM. The length and sending path of the MP_CONFIRM are dependent 
on the confirmed options, which will be copied verbatim and appended as list of options.

~~~~

The MP_JOIN option is used to add a new subflow to an existing MP-DCCP
connection. The Path Token is the SHA256 hash of the derived key (d-key),
which was previously exchanged with the MP_KEY option.
MP_HMAC MUST be set when using MP_JOIN to provide authentication (See
MP_HMAC for details). Also MP_KEY MUST be set to provide key material
for authentication purposes.

The MP_JOIN option includes an "Address ID".  This is an identifier
generated by the sender of the option, used to identify the source
address of this packet, even if the IP header has been changed in
transit by a middlebox.  The numeric value of this field is generated
by the sender and must map uniquely to a source IP address for the
sending host.  The Address ID allows address removal ({{MP_REMOVEADDR}})
without needing to know what the source address at the receiver is,
thus allowing address removal through NATs.  The Address ID also
allows correlation between new subflow setup attempts and address
signaling ({{MP_ADDADDR}}), to prevent setting up duplicate subflows
on the same path, if an MP_JOIN and MP_ADDADDR are sent at the same
time.

The Address IDs of the subflow used in the initial DCCP Request/Response exchange of
the first subflow in the connection are implicit, and have the value
zero.  A host MUST store the mappings between Address IDs and
addresses both for itself and the remote host.  An implementation
will also need to know which local and remote Address IDs are
associated with which established subflows, for when addresses are
removed from a local or remote host. An Address ID always has to be unique
over the lifetime of a subflow and can only be re-assigned if sender and
receiver no longer have them in use.

The Nonce is a 32-bit random value locally generated for every MP_JOIN option.
Together with the Token, the Nonce value builds the basis to calculate the
HMAC used in the handshaking process as described in {{handshaking}}.

### MP_FAST_CLOSE {#MP_FAST_CLOSE}

Regular DCCP has the means of sending a Close or Reset signal to abruptly close a
connection.  With MP-DCCP, a regular Close or Reset only has the scope of the
subflow; it will only close the applicable subflow and will not
affect the remaining subflows concurrently in use on other paths.  MP-DCCP's connection will stay alive at
the data level, in order to permit break-before-make handover between
subflows.  It is therefore necessary to provide an MP-DCCP-level
"Reset" to allow the abrupt closure of the whole MP-DCCP connection;
this is done via the MP_FAST_CLOSE option.

For being effective, the MP_FAST_CLOSE must be sent from an initiating host on all subflows as part of a DCCP-Reset packet with Reset Code 13. To protect unauthorized shutdown of a multi-path connection, the selected Key Data of the peer host during the handshaking procedure is carried by the MP_FAST_CLOSE option. With completion of this step, the initiating host can tear down the subflows and the multi-path connection immediately terminates.
Upon reception of the MP_FAST_CLOSE and validation of the Key Data at the peer host, a DCCP Reset packet is replied on all subflows to the initiating host again with Reset Code 13. The peer host can now close the whole MP-DCCP connection (it transitions directly to CLOSED state).

The MP_KEY suboption is used to exchange key material between
hosts. The Length varies between 12 and 68 Bytes for a single-key message, and up to
110 Bytes when all specified Key Types 0-2 are provided. The Key Type field is used to
specify the type of the following key data. Key types are shown in {{ref-key-type-list}}.

{{RFC6234}}, with the output truncated to the leftmost 160 bits (20 bytes).

The "Key" used for the HMAC computation is the derived key (d-key)
described in {{MP_KEY}}, while the HMAC "Message" is a concatenation of

   * MP_JOIN: The token and nonce of the MP_JOIN for which authentication
   shall be performed.

The MP_RTT option is used to transmit RTT values in milliseconds and
MUST belong to the path over which this information is transmitted.
Additionally, the age of the measurement is specified in milliseconds.

The RTT and Age information is a 32-bit integer, which allows to cover a period of
approximately 1193 hours.

   and the conducted RTT measurement in milliseconds. If no previous measurement
   exists, e.g., when initialized, the value is 0.
{: vspace='0'}


### MP_ADDADDR {#MP_ADDADDR}

The MP_ADDADDR option announces additional addresses (and, optionally,
ports) on which a host can be reached. This option can be used at any
time during an existing DCCP connection, when the sender wishes to
enable multiple paths and/or when additional paths become available.
Multiple instances of this option within a packet advertise simultaneously
new addresses.

Length is variable depending on IPv4 or IPv6 and whether port number is
used and is in range between 8 and 22 bytes.

The presence of the final 2 octets, specifying the DCCP port number to
use, are optional and can be inferred from the length of the option.
Although it is expected that the majority of use cases will use the
same port pairs as used for the initial subflow (e.g., port 80
remains port 80 on all subflows, as does the ephemeral port at the
client), there may be cases (such as port-based load balancing) where
the explicit specification of a different port is required.  If no
port is specified, MP-DCCP SHOULD attempt to connect to the specified
address on the same port as is already in use by the subflow on which
the MP_ADDADDR signal was sent.

Along with the MP_ADDADDR option a MP_HMAC option MUST be sent for
authentication. The truncated HMAC parameter present in this MP_HMAC
option is the leftmost 20 bytes of an HMAC, negotiated and calculated
as described in {{MP_HMAC}}. In the same way as for MP_JOIN,
the key for the HMAC algorithm, in the case of the message transmitted
by Host A, will be Key-A followed by Key-B, and in the case of Host B,
Key-B followed by Key-A.  These are the keys that were exchanged and
selected in the original MP_KEY handshake. The message for the HMAC is
the Address ID, IP address, and port that precede the HMAC in the
MP_ADDADDR option.  If the port is not present in the MP_ADDADDR option,
the HMAC message will nevertheless include 2 octets of value zero.
The rationale for the HMAC is to prevent unauthorized entities from
injecting MP_ADDADDR signals in an attempt to hijack a connection.
Note that, additionally, the presence of this HMAC prevents the
address from being changed in flight unless the key is known by an
intermediary.  If a host receives an MP_ADDADDR option for which it
cannot validate the HMAC, it SHOULD silently ignore the option.

Every address has an Address ID that can be used for uniquely
identifying the address within a connection for address removal. The
Address ID is also used to identify MP_JOIN options (see {{MP_JOIN}})
relating to the same address, even when address translators are in use.
The Address ID MUST uniquely identify the address for the sender of the
option (within the scope of the connection); the mechanism for
allocating such IDs is implementation specific.

All Address IDs learned via either MP_JOIN or MP_ADDADDR SHOULD be stored
by the receiver in a data structure that gathers all the
Address-ID-to-address mappings for a connection (identified by a token
pair). In this way, there is a stored mapping between the Address ID,
observed source address, and token pair for future processing of control
information for a connection. Note that an implementation
MAY discard incoming address advertisements at will, for example, for
avoiding the required mapping state, or because advertised addresses
are of no use to it (for example, IPv6 addresses when it has IPv4
only).  Therefore, a host MUST treat address advertisements as soft
state, and it MAY choose to refresh advertisements periodically.

Due to the proliferation of NATs, it is reasonably likely that one
host may attempt to advertise private addresses.  It is not
desirable to prohibit this, since there may be cases where both hosts
have additional interfaces on the same private network, and a host
MAY want to advertise such addresses. The MP_JOIN handshake to
create a new subflow ({{MP_JOIN}}) provides mechanisms to minimize
security risks.  The MP_JOIN message contains a 32-bit token that
uniquely identifies the connection to the receiving host. If the
token is unknown, the host will return with a DCCP-Reset. In the unlikely
event that the token is known, subflow setup will continue, but the
HMAC exchange must occur for authentication.  This will fail, and
will provide sufficient protection against two unconnected hosts
accidentally setting up a new subflow upon the signal of a private
address.  Further security considerations around the issue of
MP_ADDADDR messages that accidentally misdirect, or maliciously direct,
new MP_JOIN attempts are discussed in {{security}}.

The reception of an MP_ADDADDR message is acknowledged using MP_CONFIRM
({{MP_CONFIRM}}). Using this mechanism reliable exchange of address
information is ensured.

A host can send an MP_ADDADDR message with an already assigned Address
ID, but the Address MUST be the same as previously assigned to this
Address ID, and the Port MUST be different from one already in use
for this Address ID.  If these conditions are not met, the receiver
SHOULD silently ignore the MP_ADDADDR.  A host wishing to replace an
existing Address ID MUST first remove the existing one ({{MP_REMOVEADDR}}).

A host that receives an MP_ADDADDR but finds a connection set up to
that IP address and port number is unsuccessful SHOULD NOT perform
further connection attempts to this address/port combination for this
connection. However, a sender that wants to trigger a new incoming
connection attempt on a previously advertised address/port combination
can therefore refresh MP_ADDADDR information by sending the option again.

### MP_REMOVEADDR {#MP_REMOVEADDR}

If, during the lifetime of an MP-DCCP connection, a previously announced
address becomes invalid (e.g., if the interface disappears), the
affected host SHOULD announce this so that the peer can remove subflows
related to this address.

This is achieved through the Remove Address (MP_REMOVEADDR) option which
will remove a previously added address with an Address ID from a
connection and terminate any subflows currently using that address.

Along with the MP_REMOVEADDR option a MP_HMAC option MUST be sent for
authentication. The truncated HMAC parameter present in this MP_HMAC
option is the leftmost 20 bytes of an HMAC, negotiated and calculated
as described in {{MP_HMAC}}. In the same way as for MP_JOIN,
the key for the HMAC algorithm, in the case of the message transmitted
by Host A, will be Key-A followed by Key-B, and in the case of Host B,
Key-B followed by Key-A.  These are the keys that were exchanged and
selected in the original MP_KEY handshake. The message for the HMAC is
the Address ID.
The rationale for the HMAC is to prevent unauthorized entities from
injecting MP_REMOVEADDR signals in an attempt to hijack a connection.
Note that, additionally, the presence of this HMAC prevents the
address from being removed in flight unless the key is known by an
intermediary.  If a host receives an MP_REMOVEADDR option for which it
cannot validate the HMAC, it SHOULD silently ignore the option.

The reception of an MP_REMOVEADDR message is acknowledged using MP_CONFIRM
({{MP_CONFIRM}}). Using this mechanism reliable exchange of address
information is ensured.

The sending and receipt of this message SHOULD trigger the sending of
DCCP-Close and DCCP-Reset by client and server, respectively on the affected
subflow(s) (if possible), as a courtesy to cleaning up middlebox state, before
cleaning up any local state.

Address removal is undertaken by ID, so as to permit the use of NATs and
other middleboxes that rewrite source addresses.  If there is no address
at the requested ID, the receiver will silently ignore the request.

### MP_PRIO {#MP_PRIO}

In the event that a single specific path out of the set of available
paths shall be treated with higher priority compared to the others
when making scheduling decisions for user plane traffic, a host may 
wish to signal such change in priority  to the peer.
One reason for such behavior is due to the different costs involved in
using different paths (e.g., WiFi is free while cellular has limit on
volume, 5G has higher energy consumption). Also, the priority of a path
may be subject to dynamic changes, for example when the mobile runs out
of battery, the usage of only a single path may be the preferred choice
of the user. Therefore, the path priority should be considered as hints 
for the packet scheduler when making decisions which path to use for 
user plane traffic.

The MP_PRIO option, shown below, can be used to set a priority flag
for the path which is specified by the AddrID field that uniquely
identifies the path. The option can be sent over any path.

       other secondary or primary paths are not established. 
*   2: Secondary: do not use this path for traffic scheduling, if the other
       paths are good enough. The path will be used occasionally for increasing 
       temporarily the available capacity, e.g. when primary paths are 
       congested or are not available. This is the recommended setting for
       paths that have costs or data caps as these paths will be used less
       frequently then primary paths.
*   3 - 15: Primary: can use the path in any way deemed reasonable by peer. 
       The path will always be used for packet scheduling decisions. The 
       priority number indicates the relative priority of one path over the 
       other for primary paths. Higher numbers indicate higher priority. 
       The peer should consider sending more traffic over higher priority paths. 
       This is the recommended setting for paths that do not have a cost or 
       data caps associated with them as these paths will be frequently used.

Example use cases include:
1) Setting Wi-Fi path to Primary and Cellular paths to Secondary. In this case
   Wi-Fi will be used and Cellular only if the Wi-Fi path is congested or not
   available. Such setting results in using the Cellular path only temporally, 
   if more capacity is needed than the WiFi path can provide, indicating a 
   clear priority of the Wi-Fi path over the Cellular due to e.g. cost reasons.
2) Setting Wi-Fi path to Primary and Cellular to Standby. In this case Wi-Fi
   will be used and Cellular only, if the Wi-Fi path is not available. 
3) Setting Wi-Fi path to Primary and Cellular path to Primary. In this case,
   all packets can be scheduled  over all paths at all time. 

If not specified, the default behavior is, that a path can always be used for 
packet scheduling decisions (MP_PRIO=3), if the path has been established and 
added to an existing MP-DCCP connection. At least one path should have a 
MP_PRIO value greater or equal to one for it to be allowed to send on the 
connection. MP_PRIO is assumed to be exchanged reliably using the MP_CONFIRM 
mechanisms (see {{ref-mp-option-confirm}}).

For a graceful shutdown of a MP-DCCP connection, MP_CLOSE is used to communicate this to a peer host. On all subflows, the regular termination procedure as described in {{RFC4340}} MUST be initiated using MP_CLOSE in the initial packet (either a DCCP-CloseReq or a DCCP-Close). In the case where a DCCP-CloseReq is used, the following DCCP-Close MUST carry the MP_CLOSE as well. At the initiator of the DCCP-CloseReq all sockets, including the MP-DCCP connection socket, transition to CLOSEREQ state. To protect unauthorized shutdown of a multi-path connection, the selected Key Data of the peer host during the handshaking procedure MUST be carried by the MP_CLOSE option and validated by the peer host. Note, Key Data is different between MP_CLOSE option carried by DCCP-CloseReq or DCCP-Close.

On reception of a first DCCP-CloseReq carrying a MP_CLOSE with valid Key Data, or due to a local decision, all subflows transition to the CLOSING state before transmitting a DCCP-Close carrying MP_CLOSE. In this case, the MP-DCCP connection socket on the host sending the DCCP-Close reflects the state of the initial subflow used during handshake with MP_KEY option. If the initial subflow no longer exists, the state moves immediately to CLOSED.

Upon reception of the first DCCP-Close carrying a MP_CLOSE with valid Key Data at the peer host, all subflows, as well as the MP-DCCP connection socket, move to the CLOSED state. After this, a DCCP-Reset with Reset Code 1 MUST be sent on any subflow in response to a received DCCP-Close containing a valid MP_CLOSE option.

When the MP-DCCP connection socket is in CLOSEREQ or CLOSE state, new subflow requests using MP_JOIN MUST be ignored.

Contrary to a MP_FAST_CLOSE {{MP_FAST_CLOSE}}, no single-sided abrupt termination is applied.

{: #ref-mp-dccp-handshaking title='Example MP-DCCP Handshake'}

The basic initial handshake for the first subflow is as follows:

* Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
  request and the MP_KEY option with an Host-specific Key-A for
  each of supported types as described in {{MP_KEY}}

* Host B sends a DCCP-Response with Confirm feature for
  MP-Capable and the MP_Key option with a single Host-specific Key-B.
  The type of the key MUST be chosen from the list of supported types
  from the previous request

* Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with both Keys echoed to Host B.

* Host B sends a DCCP-Ack to confirm both keys and conclude the handshaking.

Host A MUST wait the final DCCP-Ack from host B before starting any
establishment of additional subflow connections.

The handshake for subsequent subflows based on a successful initial
handshake is as follows:

* Host A sends a DCCP-Request with the MP-Capable feature Change
  request and the MP_JOIN option with Host B’s Token TB, generated from
  the derived key by applying a SHA256 hash and truncating to the first
  32 bits. Additionally, an own random nonce RA is transmitted with the
  MP_JOIN.

* Host B computes the HMAC of the DCCP-Request and sends a DCCP-Response
  with Confirm feature option for MP-Capable and the MP_JOIN option with
  the Token TB and a random nonce RB together with the computed MP_HMAC.
  The HMAC is calculated by taking the leftmost 20 bytes from the SHA256 hash
  of a HMAC code created by using token and nonce received with MP_JOIN(A) as message
  and the derived key described in {{MP_KEY}} as key:

  MP_HMAC(B) = HMAC-SHA256(Key=d-key(B), Msg=RB+RA)

* Host A sends a DCCP-Ack with the HMAC computed for the DCCP-Response.
  The HMAC is calculated by taking the leftmost 20 bytes from the SHA256 hash
  of a HMAC code created by using token and nonce received with MP_JOIN(B) as message
  and the derived key described in {{MP_KEY}} as key:

  MP_HMAC(A) = HMAC-SHA256(Key=d-key(A), Msg=RA+RB)

* Host B sends a DCCP-Ack to confirm the HMAC and to conclude the
  handshaking.

## Close a MP-DCCP connection {#closing}

When a host wants to close an existing subflow but not the whole
connection, it can initiate the regular DCCP connection termination procedure 
as described in {{RFC4340}}, by using a DCCP-Close/DCCP-Reset on the subflow. This
can optionally be preceded by a DCCP-CloseReq.

When a host wants to terminate the MP-DCCP connection, the recommended approach is to
initiate the standard DCCP connection termination on each subflow with the first packet on 
each subflow carrying MP_CLOSE, as described in {{MP_CLOSE}}.

      Host A                                   Host B
      ------                                   ------
                                       <-      Optional DCCP-CloseReq +
                                               MP_CLOSE [A's key] 
                                               [on all subflows]
      DCCP-Close + MP_CLOSE            ->
      [B's key] [on all subflows]
                                       <-      DCCP-Reset
                                               [on all subflows]

Additionally, a MP-DCCP connection may be closed abruptly using the "Fast Close"
procedure described in {{MP_FAST_CLOSE}}, where a DCCP-Reset is sent on all
subflows, each carrying the MP_FAST_CLOSE option.

      Host A                                   Host B
      ------                                   ------
      DCCP-Reset + MP_FAST_CLOSE       ->
      [B's key] [on all subflows]
                                       <-      DCCP-Reset
                                               [on all subflows]
                                               
## Fallback {#fallback}

When a subflow fails to operate within the MP-DCCP requirements, it is 
necessary to fall back to the safe operation. This may be either falling back 
to regular DCCP, or removing a problematic subflow. The main reasons for 
subflow failing include: no MP support at peer host, failure to negotiate protocol
version, loss of MP-DCCP options, faulty/non-supported MP-DCCP options or modification
of payload data. 

At the start of the MP-DCCP connection, the handshake ensures exchange of MP-DCCP feature and
options and thus ensures that the path is fully MP-DCCP capable. If during the
handshake procedure it appears that DCCP-Request or DCCP-Response
messages don’t carry the MP_CAPABLE feature, the MP-DCCP connection will not be 
established and the handshake SHOULD fall back to regular DCCP or MUST be closed. 

The same fallback SHOULD take place if the endpoints fail to agree on a protocol
version to use during the Multipath Capable feature negotiation, which is described
in {{mp_capable}}. The protocol version negotiation distinguishes between negotiation
for the initial connection establishment, and addition of subsequent subflows. If
protocol version negotiation is not successful during the initial connection establishment,
MP-DCCP connection will fall back to regular DCCP. 

Similar procedure MUST be applied if the MP_KEY {{MP_KEY}} Key Type cannot be negotiated,
a final ACK carrying MP_KEY with wrong Key-A/Key-B is received or MP_KEY option is malformed.

If a subflow attempts to join an existing MP-DCCP connection, but MP-DCCP options or MP_CAPABLE
feature are not present or are faulty in the handshake procedure, that subflow MUST be closed.
This is especially the case if a different MP_CAPABLE version than the originally negotiated
version is used. Also non-verifiable MP_HMAC {{MP_HMAC}} or MP_JOIN Path Token {{MP_JOIN}} MUST
lead to a subflow closing.

Another relevant case is when payload data is modified by middleboxes. DCCP uses 
checksum to protect the data, as described in section 9 of {{RFC4340}}. A checksum will 
fail if the data has been changed in any way. All data from the start of the segment that
failed the checksum onwards cannot be considered trustworthy. DCCP defines that if 
the checksum fails, the receiving endpoint MUST drop the application data and report 
that data as dropped due to corruption using a Data Dropped option (Drop Code 3, 
Corrupt). If this happens in an MP-DCCP connection, the affected subflow can either be closed or other action can be taken. 

## Congestion Control Considerations

Senders MUST manage per-path congestion status, and SHOULD avoid to send
more data on a given path than congestion control on that path
allows.

When a Multipath DCCP connection uses two or more paths, there is no
guarantee that these paths are fully disjoint.  When two (or more
paths) share the same bottleneck, using a standard congestion control
scheme could result in an unfair distribution of the bandwidth with
the multipath connection getting more bandwidth than competing single
path connections.  Multipath TCP uses the coupled congestion control
Linked Increases Algorithm (LIA) specified in [RFC6356] to
solve this problem.  This scheme can be adapted also for Multipath DCCP.
The same applies to other coupled congestion control schemes, which
have been proposed for Multipath TCP such as Opportunistic Linked
Increases Algorithm [OLIA].

## Maximum Packet Size Considerations

A DCCP implementation MUST maintain the maximum packet size (MPS) during operation of a DCCP session. This procedure is specified for single-path DCCP in {{RFC4340}}, Section 14. Without any restrictions, this is adopted for MP-DCCP operations, in particular the PMTU measurement and the Sender Behaviour. As per this definition a DCCP application interface SHOULD let the application discover the current MPS, this is subject to ambiguity with potential different path MPS in a multi-path system. For compatibility reasons, a MP-DCCP implementation SHOULD always announce the minimum MPS across all paths.


# Security Considerations {#security}

Similar to DCCP, MP-DCCP does not provide cryptographic security
guarantees inherently. Thus, if applications need cryptographic security
(integrity, authentication, confidentiality, access control, and
anti-replay protection) the use of IPsec or some other kind of
end-to-end security is recommended;
Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) {{RFC3711}} is one candidate
protocol for authentication. Together with Encryption of Header
Extensions in SRTP, as provided by {{RFC6904}}, also integrity would
be provided.

As described in {{RFC4340}}, DCCP provides protection against hijacking
and limits the potential impact of some denial-of-service attacks, but
DCCP provides no inherent protection against attackers’ snooping on data
packets. Regarding the security of MP-DCCP no additional risks should be
introduced compared to regular DCCP. Thereof derived are the
following key security requirements to be fulfilled by MP-DCCP:

* Provide a mechanism to confirm that parties involved in a subflow
  handshake are identical to those in the original connection setup.
* Provide verification that the new address to be included in a MP
  connection is valid for a peer to receive traffic at before using it.
* Provide replay protection, i.e., ensure that a request to add/remove a
  subflow is 'fresh'. 

In order to achieve these goals, MP-DCCP includes a hash-based handshake
algorithm documented in Sections {{MP_KEY}} and {{handshaking}}. The
security of the MP-DCCP connection depends on the use of keys that are
shared once at the start of the first subflow and are never sent again
over the network. To ease demultiplexing while not giving away any
cryptographic material, future subflows use a truncated cryptographic
hash of this key as the connection identification "token". The keys are
concatenated and used as keys for creating Hash-based Message
Authentication Codes (HMACs) used on subflow setup, in order to verify
that the parties in the handshake are the same as in the original
connection setup. It also provides verification that the peer can
receive traffic at this new address. Replay attacks would still be
possible when only keys are used;
therefore, the handshakes use single-use random numbers (nonces) at both
ends -- this ensures that the HMAC will never be the same on two handshakes.
Guidance on generating random numbers suitable for use as keys is given
in {{RFC4086}}. During normal operation, regular DCCP protection
mechanisms (such as header checksum to protect DCCP headers against
corruption) will provide the same level of protection against attacks on
individual DCCP subflows as exists for regular DCCP. 

As discussed in {{MP_ADDADDR}}, a host may advertise its private
addresses, but these might point to different hosts in the receiver's
network.  The MP_JOIN handshake ({{MP_JOIN}}) will ensure that this
does not succeed in setting up a subflow to the incorrect host.
However, it could still create unwanted DCCP handshake traffic.  This
feature of MP-DCCP could be a target for denial-of-service exploits,
with malicious participants in MP-DCCP connections encouraging the
recipient to target other hosts in the network.  Therefore,
implementations should consider heuristics at both the
sender and receiver to reduce the impact of this.

# Interactions with Middleboxes {#middlebox}

Issues from interaction with on-path middleboxes such as NATs, firewalls, proxies,
intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and others have to be considered for all
extensions to standard protocols since otherwise unexpected reactions of
middleboxes may hinder its deployment. DCCP already provides means to
mitigate the potential impact of middleboxes, also in comparison to TCP (see
{{RFC4043}}, sect. 16). In case, however, both hosts are located behind a NAT or
firewall entity, specific measures have to be applied such as the {{RFC5596}}-specified
simultaneous-open technique that update the (traditionally asymmetric)
connection-establishment procedures for DCCP.  Further standardized technologies
addressing NAT type middleboxes are covered by {{RFC5597}}.

{{RFC6773}} specifies UDP Encapsulation for NAT Traversal of DCCP sessions,
similar to other UDP encapsulations such as for SCTP {{RFC6951}}. The alternative
U-DCCP approach proposed in {{I-D.amend-tsvwg-dccp-udp-header-conversion}} would
reduce tunneling overhead. The handshaking procedure for DCCP-UDP
header conversion or use of a DCCP-UDP negotiation procedure to signal support
for DCCP-UDP header conversion would require encapsulation during the handshakes
and use of two additional port numbers out of the UDP port number space, but
would require zero overhead afterwards.


# Implementation

The approach described above has been implemented in open source across different testbeds and a new scheduling algorithm has been extensively tested. Also 
demonstrations of a laboratory setup have been executed and have been published at {{website}}.

# Differences from Multipath TCP {#diff_mptcp}

Multipath DCCP is similar to Multipath TCP {{RFC8684}}, in that it
extends the related basic DCCP transport protocol {{RFC4340}} with
multipath capabilities in the same way as Multipath TCP extends TCP
{{RFC0793}}.
However, because of the differences between the underlying TCP and DCCP
protocols, the transport characteristics of MPTCP and MP-DCCP are
different.

{{table_tcp_dccp_comp}} compares the protocol characteristics of TCP
and DCCP, which are by nature inherited by their respective multipath
extensions.  A major difference lies in the delivery of payload, which
is for TCP an exact copy of the generated byte-stream. DCCP behaves
in a different way and does not guarantee to deliver any payload nor the
order of delivery.
Since this is mainly affecting the receiving endpoint of a TCP or
DCCP communication, many similarities on the sender side can be identified.
Both transport protocols share the 3-way initiation of a
communication and both employ congestion control to adapt the sending
rate to the path characteristics.

Consequently, the multipath features, shown in
{{table_mptcp_mpdccp_comp}}, are the same, supporting volatile paths
having varying capacity and latency, session handover and path
aggregation capabilities. All of them profit by the existence of
congestion control.

Therefore, the sender logic is not much different between MP-DCCP and
MPTCP.

The receiver side for MP-DCCP has to deal with the unreliable transport 
character of DCCP. The multipath sequence numbers included in MP-DCCP (see {{MP_SEQ}}) facilitates
adding optional mechanisms for data stream packet reordering 
at the receiver.  Information from the MP_RTT multipath option ({{MP_RTT}}), 
DCCP path sequencing and the DCCP Timestamp Option provide further means 
for advanced reordering approaches, e.g., as described in {{I-D.amend-iccrg-multipath-reordering}}.
Such mechanisms do, however, not affect interoperability
and are not part of the MP-DCCP protocol.  Many 
applications that use unreliable transport protocols can also inherently deal 
with out-of-sequence data (e.g., through adaptive audio and video buffers), 
and so additional reordering support may not be necessary. The addition of optional 
reordering mechanisms are most likely to be needed when the 
different DCCP subflows are routed across paths with different latencies. 
In theory, applications using DCCP are aware that packet reordering might 
happen, since DCCP has no mechanisms to prevent it.

The receiving process for MPTCP is on the other hand a rigid
"just wait" approach, since TCP guarantees reliable delivery.
